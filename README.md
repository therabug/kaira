*Kaira As Is Really in Adequate*  
A simple yet fun game engine! This project was created for learning, experimenting, and having some fun. We fully embrace being "radically inadequate" and make no excuses for it! 😄

## 🚀 Features

kairadot currently includes the following essential components for a basic game engine:  
- **Game Loop:** A stable main loop for running the game logic.  
- **State Machine:** A simple state management system for controlling game states.  
- **Input Manager:** A lightweight input handling system.  

## 🛠️ Built With

- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)  
  A simple and fast multimedia library for 2D graphics, audio, and input handling.  
- C++  
  A powerful, performance-oriented language (with an occasional need for extra coffee ☕).  

## 🎯 Goals

kairadot doesn’t aim for an end-user audience—this is a personal project built purely for fun and learning. However, if you decide to check it out, I hope you find something interesting!  

Potential future improvements:  
- A simple physics engine.  
- Animation support.  
- A more flexible entity management system.
